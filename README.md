# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a  two-player game played on a 3×3 grid. One player uses X and the other uses O. Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty box. The player who first forms a line of three same symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all boxes are filled and no one makes a line of three, the game ends in a draw.
